Thing that lets you try out maxpanel.

### Steps to try it.

1. Install docker and docker-compose.
2. git clone MaxScale into maxscale/maxscale.
3. Check out whatever branch you want to build this with in maxscale/maxscale. I recommend something bleeding edge.
4. Run ```docker-compose build```.
5. Wait a long while.
6. Run ```docker-compose up```.
7. Visit port 8080 of localhost or whatever box your docker containers run on.
